!!! Warning
    The Simucube Throttle does not include a USB hub and necessitates connection to an ActivePedal in order to function.

## ActivePedal compability

Throttle is designed to be used with ActivePedal and it may be wired to one of ActivePedal's external pedal ports. This allows you to configure Throttle pedal through Tuner. In addition, you can continue to use "Connectable" passive pedals as previously for example as a clutch pedal. 

### Connectable passive pedals

Supported with separately sold link cable:

* Heusinkveld Sim Pedals Sprint
* Heusinkveld Sim Pedals Ultimate
* Heusinkveld Sim Pedals Ultimate+
