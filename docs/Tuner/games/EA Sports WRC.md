# EA Sports WRC

Tuner can handle configuring telemetry automatically, after the game is started and closed once, when
Tuner is also running.

Tuner will automatically patch "Documents/My Games/WRC/telemetry/config.json" and add custom telemetry packet type for itself. It uses port 27878 by default.
