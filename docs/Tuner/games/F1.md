### FAQ

#### Tuner detects the game running but says "Waiting for telemetry data from the game" even when simulation is already running

This indicates that Tuner does not receive telemetry data from the game. This can be due to configuration not matching the above default configuration.

This game uses UDP technology to deliver telemetry data. Only one application can listen to a single UDP port at once. That primary telemetry receiver must then forward the telemetry data for other application that require data. So if any other app is using this game's telemetry data (i.e. Simhub), then Tuner connection to data may be blocked.

SimHub also defaults to using port 20777 for the telemetry data from F1 games, which leads to either Tuner or SimHub not getting the telemetry data. Easiest way to resolve is to set the game to use UDP port 20776 for the telemetry data and then configuring SimHub to use that port for receiving data and then forward it to Tuner that listens port 20777. [See SimHub documentation for UDP forwarding](https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Sharing-UDP-data-with-other-applications).
